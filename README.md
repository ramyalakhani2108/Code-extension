- **Global State Storage**: Persistent data storage without external databases

### Data Storage
- Todos are stored in VS Code's `globalState`
- Data persists across workspace changes and VS Code restarts
- No external dependencies or cloud storage required

## Development

### Building the Extension
```bash
npm run compile          # Compile TypeScript
npm run watch           # Watch mode for development
npm run package         # Create VSIX package
npm run lint            # Run ESLint
npm run test            # Run tests
```

### Testing
1. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
2. The extension will be loaded in the new window
3. Test all features in the development environment

### Debugging
- Set breakpoints in TypeScript files
- Use VS Code's built-in debugger
- Console logs appear in the Extension Host output

## Known Issues
